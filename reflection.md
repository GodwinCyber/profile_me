# AI-Assisted Development: A Reflection

This project was built with the extensive use of an AI assistant, which had a significant impact on the development process. This document reflects on what worked well, what felt limiting, and what I learned about using AI as a development partner.

## What Worked Well

The AI assistant excelled at tasks that involved boilerplate generation and code refactoring. For example, when creating new components or pages, I was able to provide a high-level description of the desired functionality, and the assistant would generate the initial code structure, including state management, event handlers, and basic JSX. This saved a significant amount of time and allowed me to focus on the more complex and unique aspects of the project.

The assistant was also very effective at refactoring existing code. When I needed to separate the request handler logic from the server setup in the `send-whatsapp` function, the assistant was able to perform the refactoring quickly and accurately, creating new files and updating the import statements as needed. This was a task that would have been tedious and error-prone to do manually.

Furthermore, the AI assistant was a huge help with documentation. It was able to generate clear and concise docstrings for all the functions in the codebase, as well as a comprehensive README file. The assistant was able to infer the purpose of each function from its name and code, and it was able to generate documentation that was both accurate and easy to understand.

## What Felt Limiting

The most significant limitation I encountered was the AI's inability to reliably interact with the file system. I ran into several "permission denied" errors when trying to create or modify files, which was a major bottleneck. This required me to manually intervene or find workarounds, which slowed down the development process.

Another limitation was the assistant's context window. While it has a large context window, there were times when it seemed to lose track of previous conversations or decisions. This required me to repeat myself or provide more context than I would have liked. For example, I had to remind the assistant about the file permission issues on multiple occasions.

Finally, the assistant sometimes struggled with ambiguous requests. The initial request to "fix every sign" was a good example of this. It took some clarification and iteration to understand that the user wanted me to fix typos. A human developer would have likely asked for clarification immediately.

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about how to effectively work with an AI assistant. I learned that the key to getting good results is to provide clear, specific, and detailed prompts. Instead of asking the assistant to "fix the images," I learned to ask it to "find the PNG logos for each technology, download them, and update the `Image` components."

I also learned the importance of iteration. The best results came from an iterative process of prompting, reviewing, and refining. I would often start with a high-level prompt, review the assistant's output, and then provide more specific instructions to get the desired result.

Finally, I learned that while the AI assistant is a powerful tool, it's not a replacement for a human developer. It's crucial to carefully review all the code and changes generated by the assistant to ensure they are correct and meet the project's requirements. The assistant is a powerful tool for augmenting a developer's workflow, but it's not a substitute for human expertise and judgment.
